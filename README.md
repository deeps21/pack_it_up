# **PACK IT UP**
## **Optimal Solution for food Packaging**


### Problem Statement :
Packaging format for food products need to be designed based on a simulation model.
This model should provide the optimum results for the packing of the product mostly cost.
A simulation has to be done basis forces that products undergo during the journey in the supply chain.

### Solution :
A website in which the properties of the objects will be taken as an input and then select the best suitable material for that in which
object can sustain much longer also the most optimum orientation and design of the product which can minimize the area of packing.
In this whole process the cost optimization is the prime objective.
